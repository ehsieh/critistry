# Critistry.com

Critistry.com is a website for artists of all levels to connect and form online critique groups to give feedback and critique on each other's artwork.  Critistry.com started out as a personal project to learn a new web development stack that is different from what I use at work.  This stack includes the following:

  * Elxiir
  * Pheonix and Ecto
  * PostgreSQL
  * GraphQL with Absinthe
  * Apollo Cleint
  * React
