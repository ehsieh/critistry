# Critistry.com

Critistry.com is a website for artists of all levels to connect and form online critique groups to give feedback and critique on each other's artwork.  Critistry.com started out as a personal project to learn a new web development stack that is different from what I use at work.  This stack includes the following:

  * Elixir
  * Phoenix and Ecto
  * PostgreSQL
  * GraphQL with Absinthe
  * Apollo Client
  * React  

Site: [www.critistry.com](http://www.critistry.com)

This prototype repo has been replaced by a new implementation with [GraphQL backend](http://github.com/ehsieh/critistry_api) and [React front end](http://github.com/ehsieh/critistry-app)
